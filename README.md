Brownie world is a fully responsive, single-page website built using vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Designed for a home-based baking business, this modern landing page highlights delicious handmade treats with smooth UI/UX and interactive features.

It showcases products like brownies and cakes, offers an e-commerce-like experience (without a backend), and is perfect for attracting and engaging local customers. Whether on mobile or desktop, the site ensures a seamless browsing experience.

✨ Key Features

Fully Responsive Design: A mobile-first approach ensures the site looks great on all devices, from small phones to large desktops.

Modern Dark Theme: A visually appealing dark theme with gold and berry accents for a premium feel.

Interactive Product Cards: Users can browse products with hover effects and quick actions.

Persistent Shopping Cart: Add items to a shopping cart. The cart's state is saved in the browser's localStorage, so items are not lost on page reload.

Persistent Wishlist: Save favorite items to a wishlist, which is also saved using localStorage.

Dynamic Modals: Sleek, animated modals for the cart, wishlist, and checkout/order form.

On-Scroll Animations: Elements animate into view as the user scrolls down the page, powered by the IntersectionObserver API for optimal performance.

Interactive Testimonial Slider: A custom-built, touch-friendly slider for customer reviews.

Client-Side Form Handling: A functional contact form and order form that provide user feedback on the front end.
